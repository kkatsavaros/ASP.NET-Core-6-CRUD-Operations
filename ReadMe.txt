ASP.NET Core 6 - CRUD Operations

Database: Library


In that programm I use ASP.NET Core 6 to Read, Delete, Update and Create to a database.

It is a smoll Library that i manage Books and Authors.

I use Entity Framework Core 6 for the mapping.

I also use MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework to show how .NET helps Developers to produce a project real fast.


At the first part the produced database is empty.


At the second part i show you how to produce the Database with start data. (Seeding).

For that reason i have made a new class called "SeedData.cs" and i have added that scope in Program.cs file.


At the third part i want to add the Author of the book. Instead of destroy all programm i add the author and i make some changes to the controllers.
